<h2 class= headerbig> Beatrice </h2>
    
<img src= "images/muchado.jpg" class= picture>

<h2 class=bodycontent> Beatrice is a woman who knows what she wants. She hates the idea of marriage, enjoys bickering with Benedick, and doesn’t like men in general. In the Early Modern era, society viewed <a href="#section1">“women as inherently inferior, uncontrollable, and prone to a wide range of vices and disabilities” (Kemp 31).</a> Beatrice goes against these views and does as she pleases at the beginning of the play. </h2>
    
    
<h2 class= headertext> The Bickering Duo </h2>
    
<h3 class=bodycontent> Beatrice and her love interest, Benedick, are often shown bickering throughout the play. In one of her many insults to Benedick, Beatrice berates Benedick for talking too much saying <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/1/1/#line-1.1.114">“I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick; nobody marks you."</a> As a man in the Early Modern era, Benedick could have taken offense to this insult and punish Beatrice, but he just shoots back another insult. If Benedick wasn’t okay with her insults, Beatrice could have been in major trouble. Beatrice is brave and breaks the traditional gender roles of the time by insulting Benedick throughout the play. </h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext> Beatrice and Misogamy </h2>
    
<h3 class=bodycontent> 
<ul>
<li> <a href="#section1">“For women of the gentry and above, marriage was typically seen as the only path to be taken.” - Theresa Kemp (33)</a></li> 
<li><a href="#section1">“Marriage provided a primary means of social mobility during this time for both men and women (Wayne 11)” - Theresa Kemp (30)</a></li>  
</ul>
    
Beatrice showcases her hatred of marriage throughout the play, but women of her time were expected to get married (as shown above) and depended on it for social mobility (as shown above). But Beatrice states that she would not marry, <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/1/#line-2.1.59">“Not till God make men of some other metal than earth."</a> In the same breath, Beatrice calls men  <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/1/#line-2.1.61">“[pieces] of valiant dust."</a> Beatrice does not want to get married and will try to avoid it for as long as possible. But Beatrice knows getting married is a duty. When speaking about Hero marrying Claudio, she says that it is her <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/1/#line-2.1.52">“cousin’s duty to make cursy and say, ‘Father, as it please you.’”</a> Beatrice is aware of her duty to marry a man, yet she continues to not conform to traditional gender roles and expresses her hatred of marriage. 
</h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext> Bisexual Beatrice? </h2>
    
<h3 class= bodycontent>Beatrice makes it clear throughout the play that she does not like men in the slightest. Beatrice and Leonato discuss Beatrice marrying a man without a beard, and she explains that she would not know what to do with him, she even mentions <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/1/#line-2.1.34">“[dressing] him in [her] apparel and [making] him [her] waiting gentlewoman."</a>This quote makes it seem as if Beatrice would rather have female friends than a male companion. Beatrice’s comment could be seen as another dig at marriage, but it could also be interpreted as Beatrice not conforming to heteronormative standards of wanting to marry a man. Specifically mentioning she would use a beardless man as a waiting gentlewoman makes it seem like she enjoys the company of women instead of men. Beatrice defies traditional gender roles and exhibits queer tendencies. </h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext>Beatrice's Ending</h2>
    
<h3 class=bodycontent>Another large plot point in <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> is Don Pedro tricking Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love. After Don Pedro and Beatrice discuss marriage, Don Pedro says that Beatrice would be <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/1/#line-2.1.343">“an excellent wife for Benedick”</a> and then he decides he is going to trick Beatrice and Benedick into falling in love with each other. </h3>
    
<h2 class= littleheader> The Scheme </h2>

<h3 class=bodycontent> Don Pedro then has Leonato and Claudio lie and say that Beatrice <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/2/3/#line-2.3.108">“loves [Benedick] with an enraged affection”</a>in front of Benedick who thinks he is eavesdropping. Then to trick Beatrice, Hero and Ursula confess that Benedick <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/3/1/#line-3.1.39"> “loves Beatrice so entirely”</a> around Beatrice so she can overhear it. </h3>
    
<h2 class= littleheader> The Confession and Conclusion </h2>

<h3 class=bodycontent> At the end of the play, the two confront each other about the information they overheard. Benedick asks Beatrice if she is in love with him, and she responds: <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/5/4/#line-5.4.77"> “Why no, no more than reason."</a> When Benedick is asked the same question, he says  <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/read/5/4/#line-5.4.81"> “Troth, no; no more than reason."</a> Benedick and Beatrice only love each other platonically, not in a romantic way. However, Benedick still proposes and they end up getting married even though their feeling are misinterpreted. Beatrice’s story shows women that if they never want to get married, they will forced into marriage, because at the end of the day that is a woman’s duty. </h3>
