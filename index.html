Reading Shakespeare can be a hard task to take on, but it can be interesting depending on how you analyze it. As an English student at Millikin University, I am taking a gender and sexuality Shakespeare class, and I have learned many interesting aspects of Shakespeare’s writing. After reading four of Shakespeare’s plays, I have taken a liking to two of them.  <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/"> <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i></a> and  <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/much-ado-about-nothing/"><i>Much Ado About Nothing</i></a> were my favorite plays I read this year, and they have a plethora of issues. Although the plays have many issues, I am going to focus on how these plays perpetuate traditional gender roles in the Early Modern era.

    The two characters I am going to discuss are Katherine from <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> and Beatrice from <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>. Theresa Kemp, the author of <a href="#section1"><i>Women in the Age of Shakespeare</i></a> states that women were “restricted to marriage” in the Early Modern era. Katherine and Beatrice are not women who want to get married, yet they get forced into it because it is their duty. They are restricted to marriage and have no other choice due to their gender. After analyzing <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> and <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, it becomes apparent that Shakespeare’s writing showcases a widely known belief that women should conform to their traditional gender roles, and if women stray from them, they should be corrected or punished.
