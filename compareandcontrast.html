<h2 class=headertext>The Pair of Shrewds</h2>

<h3 class=bodycontent> Katherine and Beatrice are two women who consistently break out of the traditional gender roles of their time. Although Beatrice is given more free reign, Katherine and her have similar attitudes. Katherine is violent, clever, and forced to submit to traditional gender roles, and Beatrice is lippy, a hater of men and marriage, and also forced to submit to traditional gender roles. There are slight differences at the end of their stories, <a href= "katherine.html"> Katherine</a> is beaten into her gender role, and <a href= "beatrice.html"> Beatrice</a> is tricked into her gender role. In the end, it is clear that Shakespeareâ€™s work shows that no matter how a woman feels about marriage, it is their duty, and they will be subjected to it because of their gender. </h3>
