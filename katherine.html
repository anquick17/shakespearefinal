<img src= "images/taming.jpg" class= picture>

<h3 class= bodycontent>Katherine is an interesting character in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. She is quite clever but is quick to revert to violence. Women in the Early Modern era were supposed to be <a href="#section1">“silently beautiful beloved and not the balladeer,” (Kemp 29)</a>not so angry and violent as Katherine often is. </h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext> <b> Katherine and Bianca</b></h2>    
    
<h3 class= bodycontent>Katherine is Bianca’s lovely sister. Katherine is not the submissive and silent woman that all men want. Bianca is referred to as <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/2/1/#line-2.1.96"> “fair and virtuous”</a>, amongst many other positive compliments throughout the play. In comparison, Katherine is called <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/1/2/#line-1.2.129">“Katherine the curst”</a> and many other terrible names throughout the play. Katherine and her sister are often pitted against each other due to their differences. Men in the Early Modern era want a woman who conforms to the submissive and caring gender role of the time like Bianca, not a woman who doesn’t conform to the submissive and sweet gender roles like Katherine. </h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext> Katherine and Violence</h2>    

    <h3 class= bodycontent>However, a large issue in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> is that Bianca and Katherine’s father will not let Bianca get married until Katherine is married. Many men chase after Bianca, so they often get mad at Katherine for not being like her sister, easy to love, and desirable to men. In one situation, a possible suitor for Bianca, Hortensio, expresses his hatred towards Katherine saying, <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/1/1/#line-1.1.59"> “No mates for you, / Unless you were of gentler, milder mold.”</a> Katherine does not take kindly to this comment, and she explains to Hortensio that marriage is not on her mind, and if it were, she would <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/1/1/#line-1.1.65"> “comb [Hortensio’s] noddle with a three-legged stool. / And paint [Hortensio’s] face and use [Hortensio] like a fool.”</a> This is only one instance of Katherine reverting to violence when insulted. Later in the play, Hortensio is the victim of Katherine’s violence. Hortensio innocently tries to teach Katherine how to play the lute, but when he corrects Katherine she <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/2/1/#line-2.1.161">“[strikes him] on the head.”</a> Katherine is always quick to act with violence and stands her ground, traits a woman of her time should have avoided. </h3>
    
<h2 class= headertext> Taming Katherine</h2>    
    
<h3 class= bodycontent> Due to Katherine’s father forbidding Bianca to get married before Katherine, Bianca’s suitors convince a man to wed Katherine. The man who ends up pursuing Katherine is Petruchio. Instead of trying to love Katherine as she is, Petruchio takes her on as a challenge. Petruchio decides to tame Katherine so that she can be as <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/2/1/#line-2.1.293"> “conformable as other household Kates.”</a> Not only does Petruchio objectify Katherine by comparing her to a household cat, but he also shows his intentions to literally tame Katherine like a cat. </h3>
    
<h2 class= littleheader> The Taming School </h2>
    
<h3 class= bodycontent> Shortly after Katherine and Petruchio’s wedding, Petruchio begins his master plan to tame Katherine. After Katherine and Petruchio return home from the wedding, Katherine is <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/4/3/#line-4.3.9">“starved for meat”</a> and <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/4/3/#line-4.3.9">“giddy for lack of sleep,”</a> and at the beginning of act 4 scene 3, Petruchio’s servant denies her food when she expresses her hunger and tiredness. Along with starving Katherine and denying her any rest, Petruchio also intimidates Katherine by showing his short-temper with his staff which is another one of Petruchio’s taming methods. The first servant takes Petruchio’s boots off incorrectly and Petruchio strikes him. Another one of Petruchio’s servants doesn’t let the water basin down quickly enough, so he is also stricken. Katherine doesn’t let these malicious acts go unnoticed. Katherine acts out of character and kindly defends the servant saying <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/4/1/#line-4.1.153">“Patience, I pray you, ‘twas a fault unwilling."</a> Petruchio is doing everything in his power to force Katherine to conform to traditional gender roles and punishes her into conforming to gender roles. </h3>

<h2 class= headertext> <b>Katherine's Ending</b></h2>    
    
<h3 class= bodycontent> Katherine is eventually tamed by Petruchio due to his abuse, and Katherine shows this through her final monologue in the play. Earlier in the play, Katherine stood up to herself and didn’t need a man to protect or speak for her, but now she declares that <a href= "https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/the-taming-of-the-shrew/read/5/2/#line-5.2.162">“Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, / Thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee."</a> Petruchio beats and intimidates Katherine into conforming to the gender roles of her time. This shows women of the time that if they didn’t conform to the traditional gender roles they would be tamed by an evil man like Petruchio. </h3>
